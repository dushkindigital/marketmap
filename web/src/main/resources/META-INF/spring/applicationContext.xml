	<!-- Turn on AspectJ @Configurable support. As a result, any time you instantiate 
		an object, Spring will attempt to perform dependency injection on that object. 
		This occurs for instantiation via the "new" keyword, as well as via reflection. 
		This is possible because AspectJ is used to "weave" Roo-based applications 
		at compile time. In effect this feature allows dependency injection of any 
		object at all in your system, which is a very useful feature (without @Configurable 
		you'd only be able to dependency inject objects acquired from Spring or subsequently 
		presented to a specific Spring dependency injection method). Roo applications 
		use this useful feature in a number of areas, such as @PersistenceContext 
		injection into entities. -->
